### DeviousYarn - The String Manipulation Oriented Language.

## What is DeviousYarn?
DeviousYarn is a highly abstracted 6GL computer language developed for the sole 
purpose of making String Manipulation as easy as possible. The DeviousYarn 
interpreter lies somewhere on the line between line editor and programming 
language interpreter. 

### Pros - 
* It's easy to write.
* It's easy to read.
* "Intelligent Interpreting" throws an error for bad code, but then adapts and fixes your error during runtime.
* LISP-like syntax.
* Function notation.
* Ability to use all functions as LTR infix operators using "Fang Notation".

### Cons - 
* Lower level concepts, like byte manipulations and custom normalization, aren't friendly. 
* It's not as fast as other interpreted languages.

## How do I install it?
Check your package manager's repos for the official DeviousYarn binary. 
If it doesn't exist, request it on their forums, or add one to their user repos.

## How do I compile it?
To compile DeviousYarn, choose one of the `DeviousYarn.*` files in the root 
of the repo, and then proceed to compile it normally. 

For example -
*`go build DeviousYarn.go`

Then, move the `DeviousYarn` binary generated by the compiler into your 
/usr/bin folder as `dy` using this command - 

`mv DeviousYarn /usr/bin/dy`

That's it!
